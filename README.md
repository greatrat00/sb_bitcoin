Bitcoin Statusboard Widget

Bitcoin Statusboard Widget is a widget for Panic's status board which refreshes every 50 seconds, showing the live price of a Bitcoin in USD. The refresh is done with jQuery AJAX, the way Panic intended DIY widgets to behave.

To install, simply place index.php on your webserver and point Panic's Statusboard widget to the URL of the directory containing index.php

ENJOY!!!
